				<p>That which is not good for the swarm, neither is it good for the bee. (<i>Marcus Aurelius, 121-180 A.D.</i>)</p>

				<p>A crowd is a large and definable group of people, while "the crowd" is referred to as the so-called lower orders of people in general (the mob). A crowd may be definable through a common purpose or set of emotions, such as at a political rally, at a sports event, or during looting (this is known as a psychological crowd), or simply be made up of many people going about their business in a busy area (e.g. shopping). Everybody in the context of general public or the common people is normally referred to as the masses. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd]</a></p>
